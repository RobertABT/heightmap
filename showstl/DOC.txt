Demo of using JSC3D to view stl files in a web page

     - JSC3D is at https://code.google.com/p/jsc3d/
     - this directory has the required downloads
     - t.html is an example page which displays GENERATED.stl
       - that filename is hard coded into the html
     - there will be more parameters to all this I am sure
